## Hey there, I’m Tiago – alias @datateles! 
> “Where data flows, insight grows.”

### About Me
I’m an Analytics Engineer by day, a curious dreamer by night. 
I believe data is more than just numbers on a screen—it’s a canvas for stories yet to unfold, 
guiding us toward tomorrow’s brightest innovations.

- 👀 **Interests**: Data pipelines, transformational analytics, and the art of turning raw information into meaningful insights. 
- 🌱 **Currently learning**: Cutting-edge analytics engineering practices, advanced ETL strategies, and all things data visualization.
- 💞️ **Looking to collaborate on**: Any project that blends data, creativity, and forward-thinking solutions—especially ones that help communities and inspire growth.
- 📫 **How to reach me**: Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datateles) or drop me a message right here on GitHub.
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I’m fascinated by the hidden poetry in numbers—how each dataset can whisper a new perspective on our shared world.

With humility in discovery and empathy in design, I invite you to explore, contribute, and grow together in this space.

Let’s use data as our compass and insight as our journey—onward and upward!
